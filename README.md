# Luna E-Commerce Platform Dashboard 

This project is done from the perspective of a Chief of Staff for an eCommerce platform called Luna. The CEO has requested us to build to build a dashboard informing them on general stats of their platform. They are looking to use the information to decide which categories to invest in, which ones to monitor, and which ones to divest from.

## Actions

I performed the following actions prior to creating the dashboard: 

* Defined the users and their main objectives
* Defined the insights users are trying to gain 
* Defined the KPIs and metrics users are trying to track 
* Created a wireframe mockup of the dashboard 

I then created a dashboard based on the wireframe mockup, which initially didn't have space for all the KPIs I had listed. I decided to make the dashboard two pages, and I placed the visualizations that displayed detailed drill downs that a SME, such as a Category Manager, may use on the second page. I placed the most important and highest level KPIs at the top.
