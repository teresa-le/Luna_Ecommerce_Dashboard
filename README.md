# Luna E-Commerce Platform Dashboard 

This project is done from the perspective of a Chief of Staff for an eCommerce platform called Luna. The CEO has requested a dashboard to provide them on general statistics of their platform. They are also looking to use the information from the dashboard to help them decide which categories to invest in, which ones to monitor, and which ones to divest from. 

## Data Sources

This data is an original dataset from The Commons and can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/teresa-le/luna_ecommerce_dashboard/tree/main/resources">Resources</a> folder. 

## ðŸ›  Skills
Power BI, DAX Queries, Data Visualization 

## Actions

I performed the following actions prior to creating the dashboard: 

* Defined the users and their main objectives
* Defined the insights users are trying to gain 
* Defined the KPIs and metrics users are trying to track 
* Created a wireframe mockup of the dashboard 

For more details on the planning process, you can view the file called <a href="https://github.com/teresa-le/luna_ecommerce_dashboard/blob/main/Dashboard%20Design%20Plan.xlsx">Dashboard Design Plan</a>. 

I then created a dashboard based on the wireframe mockup, which initially didn't have space for all the KPIs I had listed. I decided to make the dashboard two pages, and I placed the visualizations that displayed detailed drill downs that a SME, such as a Category Manager, may use on the second page. I placed the most important and highest level KPIs at the top. To create some of the visualizations, I created DAX queries to obtain the values that I was looking for. 


## Results 

To view the dashboard using Power BI, you need to have Power BI installed onto your computer and need to download the file <a href="https://github.com/teresa-le/luna_ecommerce_dashboard/blob/main/Luna%20Performance%20Dashboard.pbix">Luna Performance Dashboard</a>.

Overall, Luna seems to be performing well in 2019 in comparison to 2018 despite only one of data being available in 2019 so far.
