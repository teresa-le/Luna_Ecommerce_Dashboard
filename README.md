# Luna E-Commerce Platform Dashboard 

This project is done from the perspective of a Chief of Staff for an eCommerce platform called Luna. The CEO has requested a dashboard to provide them on general statistics of their platform. They are also looking to use the information from the dashboard to help them decide which categories to invest in, which ones to monitor, and which ones to divest from. 

## Data Sources

This data is an original dataset from The Commons and can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/teresa-le/luna_ecommerce_dashboard/tree/main/resources">Resources</a> folder.

## Actions

I performed the following actions prior to creating the dashboard: 

* Defined the users and their main objectives
* Defined the insights users are trying to gain 
* Defined the KPIs and metrics users are trying to track 
* Created a wireframe mockup of the dashboard 

For more details on the planning process, you can view the file called <a href="https://github.com/teresa-le/luna_ecommerce_dashboard/blob/main/Dashboard%20Design%20Plan.xlsx">Dashboard Design Plan</a>. 

I then created a dashboard based on the wireframe mockup, which initially didn't have space for all the KPIs I had listed. I decided to make the dashboard two pages, and I placed the visualizations that displayed detailed drill downs that a SME, such as a Category Manager, may use on the second page. I placed the most important and highest level KPIs at the top. To create some of the visualizations, I created DAX queries to obtain the values that I was looking for.

Luna sells three types of products: Electronics, furniture and clothing. In 2018 and 2019, electronics and furniture hit their sales targets. More information is needed to understand why clothing missed its sales targets and what can be done to help it meet its sales targets e.g. improved marketing efforts, price optimization, etc. Overall, all product categories are profitable with electronics being the most profitable type of product. Despite this fact, clothing makes up 2/3 of Luna's orders. There is also potential room for growth by investing more to increase the sales of electronics, which appear to be more profitable. In the drilldowns, we can see that the two product subcategories that aren't producing a profit are electronics and tables. 45% or almost half of the sales on tables and chairs did not result in a profit, and the cost of acquisition may be too high given their price point. It may be worthwhile to continue to sell chairs and tables depending on whether it aligns with the strategic goals of the business and generate value long-term or not.
